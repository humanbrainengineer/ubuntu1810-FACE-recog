---3.1. Ubuntu 14.04 LTS And Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
Installing NCCL on Ubuntu requires you to first add a repository to the APT system containing the NCCL packages, 
then installing the NCCL packages through APT.
There are two repositories available; a local repository and a network repository. 
Choosing the later is recommended to easily retrieve upgrades when newer versions are posted.
Install the repository.
For the local NCCL repository:
  sudo dpkg -i nccl-repo-<version>.deb

Update the APT database:
  sudo apt update
Install the libnccl2 package with APT. 


Additionally, if you need to compile applications with NCCL, 
you can install the libnccl-dev package as well:
Note: If you are using the network repository, 
the following command will upgrade CUDA to the latest version.
  sudo apt install libnccl2 libnccl-dev

Bazel:

Using Bazel custom APT repository
Step 1: Install the JDK
Install JDK 8:
  
   sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

Step 2: Add Bazel distribution URI as a package source
Note: This is a one-time setup step.

   echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://storage.googleapis.com/bazel-apt stable jdk1.8" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bazel.list
   
   sudo apt install curl

   curl https://bazel.build/bazel-release.pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   
   

Step 3: Install and update Bazel


  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install bazel
Once installed, you can upgrade to a newer version of Bazel with the following command:

  sudo apt-get upgrade bazel
